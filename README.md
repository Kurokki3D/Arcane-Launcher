# Arcane Launcher

The final project of my time with the Technology Advancement Programme III.
This app is a home screan launcher it lists all your commonly usecapps on the main screan
in both calm mode and arcade mode. the main diference between calm mode and arcade mode
is that calm mode caters to minimalisim while arcade mode is more flashy and caters for
fantacy.

## What I Learned

This project thought me:
- How to use the manifest file to change the app compleatly.
- how to use styles to create a transparent window in flutter
- how to use Riverpod
- how to use ListWheelScrollView
